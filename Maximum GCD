Let's consider all integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).

Among all pairs of distinct integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of gcd(a,b), where 1≤a<b≤n.

The greatest common divisor, gcd(a,b), of two positive integers a and b is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both a and b.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤106).

Output
For each test case, output the maximum value of gcd(a,b) among all 1≤a<b≤n.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    int arr[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>arr[i];
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i]<=2){
            cout<<"1"<<endl;
        }else {
            cout<<arr[i]/2<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
